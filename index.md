## Well what exactly will I write about in this blog?

It is mainly my portfolio site but I will also occasionally write about stuff I feel strongly about! Like the story of "buttons"....

{% youtube X5WXaUQtPRs %}    
    
    
    Well I do not feel so strongly about this button... I kinda like this video! 


    
## Very little about me...

I was a Google Summer of Code Intern in 2012 for Connexions, Rice University on the "Donate Now Campaign" Here is a blog post after the [final evaluations](http://blog.cnx.org/2012/08/google-summer-of-code-2012-comes-to.html).
I was also the part of Team Plan-B at the CIMA GBC 2012. We were the western zone finalists and also won the best business report at the Western Zone finals.

I am currently a research assistant at CNRS, Telecom ParisTech working on the [ILHAIRE](http://ilhaire.eu) project. Over here I am synthesizing laughter!
And trying to make it as natural (I mean human-like) as possible!
