## How it all started

Through some online courses
    
    Sometime in my first year I received a mail in my gmail about three online courses! Machine Learning, HCI and Databases. 
    For some unknown reason I decided to experiment with ML and HCI! Registered for the two courses.
    Since then it has been a lot of fun!
    
    Currently I am a research assistant at the CNRS lab with the greta team synthesizing laughter as part of the ILHAIRE project. 


    
## Some other stuff I have done...

I was a Google Summer of Code Intern in 2012 for Connexions, Rice University on the "Donate Now Campaign" Here is a blog post after the [final evaluations](http://blog.cnx.org/2012/08/google-summer-of-code-2012-comes-to.html).
I was also the part of Team Plan-B at the CIMA GBC 2012. We were the western zone finalists and also won the best business report at the Western Zone finals.
    

## Some things I wanted to do, but didn't quite work out

This list is fairly big and this is mainly about some ideas I had and I wanted to implement a quick prototype of the same.
In most cases I abondoned these projects because I had no way of doing subjective evaluations. And without evaluations these projects are pretty useless.
I will occasionally write about them in separate blog posts and if you have any ideas about reviving them feel free to email me.

The "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

Nothing.
