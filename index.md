## About me...

I am Debajyoti and I work in areas of machine learning and human computer interaction...

## What exactly do you work on?

I have been working on multimodal interactions and virtual agents. I was a developer in the [ILHAIRE](http://ilhaire.eu) project and currently I am at Carnegie Mellon
University working at the [Articulab](http://www.articulab.justinecassell.com/) working on the Rapport Project. This project focuses on building virtual agents 
that would build social rapport with the students while working on a linear algebra peer tutoring session. Aprt from these I love explaining new concepts to people,
playing cricket and of course fiddling around with my rubiks cubes!

## How did it all start?

Through mainly the Google Summer of Code 2012 with Connexions and through [open-advice](http://open-advice.org/).
