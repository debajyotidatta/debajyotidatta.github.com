## How it all started?


    
    Sometime in my first year I received a mail in my gmail about three online courses! Machine Learning, HCI and Databases. Quickly found out that as part of the course we all will be taught about
    Databases. Registered for the other two courses of Andrew Ng and Scott Klemer! Two of the world's best teachers possibly (Well along with Walter Lewin, he is always in every list of best teachers!)
    totally convinced me about the awesomeness of these two fields.
    
    Since then it has been a long jouney! Will write about all that stuff sometime later.
    
    Currently I am working as a research assistant at CNRS in the [ILHAIRE](http://ilhaire.eu) project. Here I am synthesizing laughter. Yes I am making a virtual agent laugh from a variety of inputs and 
    from the next week I will be exploring the correlations of human breathing and laughter. 
    
    

This blog is mostly about the stuff I have done and learnt in the last 3 years! 
    
## I would love to hear from you!

Actually about anything you want to talk about or share!
Well you can send me a mail here at `datta24421112 at gmail dot com` but in case you like Mr. Zuckerbergs mode of communication more, reach me out at `/debajyotid' 



The post list.

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>



Do not visit my [old website](http://datta-profile.appspot.com/). I was a kid when I made it and has too many rendering issues. Was extremely lazy to fix them and decided to use Jekyll and Hooligan instead. Jekyll
because it is fairly simple to use and Hooligan because the name is pretty cool.
