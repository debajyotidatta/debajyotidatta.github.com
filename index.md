## Well what exactly will I write about in this blog?

It is mainly my portfolio site but I will also occasionally write about stuff I feel strongly about! Like the story of "buttons"....

Well on a serious note it talks about a very important concept: The importance of designing products for "humans". You must have seen too many posts about how good design and usability;
and that looks are not everything. However this place will only be about the "humans" part of Human Computer Interaction.  

And before you proceed if you have been really stressed about certain things in life and belive that the stress is bad for your health.... then see the ted video below.
If however you believe that stress is good for you, then you are on the right track to saving yourself from disastrous heart conditions and I will tell you the 6 steps to become Batman!

## About me...

I am Debajyoti. I do not hate people who still use "Comic Sans" but I am more fascinated with questions like "why do they still use it?"
I believe in super heroes and just in case you are thinking about Mahatma Gandhi, K.M Birla you are wrong. I believe in them too but I believe more in the ones from DC Comics like Batman. Well only batman!
And that by the way has nothing to do with Christopher Nolan movies.

I love the rubik's cube and until recently I had drawn more pictures than written computer programs. I cannot dance, sing or play the cello. And someday I will learn all the three.

I was a Google Summer of Code Intern in 2012 for Connexions, Rice University on the "Donate Now Campaign" Here is a blog post after the [final evaluations](http://blog.cnx.org/2012/08/google-summer-of-code-2012-comes-to.html).
I was also the part of Team Plan-B at the CIMA GBC 2012. We were the national finalists and also won the best business report at the Western Zone finals. 

I am currently a research assistant at CNRS, Telecom ParisTech working on the [ILHAIRE](http://ilhaire.eu) project. Over here I am synthesizing laughter!
And trying to make it as natural (rather as human-like) as possible! I am using a variety of approaches for doing this and hopefully by the end of the project we
will have a full body animation of the virtual agent GRETA during laughter.
