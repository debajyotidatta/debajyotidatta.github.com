I am Debajyoti Datta and I work in areas of machine learning and human computer interaction.
Currently I am a graduate student at University of Virginia, pursuing MSc in Systems and Information Engineering. 

My adviser is [Dr. Laura Barnes] (http://www.sys.virginia.edu/laura-barnes.html).

## My research interests:

I have been working on multimodal interactions and virtual agents. 
Currently I am working on developing Virtual Patients for inter-professional education as part of my masters thesis.

In the past I have been part of the [ILHAIRE](http://ilhaire.eu) project and the Rapport project at the [Articulab](http://www.articulab.justinecassell.com/) at Carnegie Mellon
University's school of Computer Science. 

Apart from these I love explaining new concepts to people,
playing cricket and of course fiddling around with my rubiks cubes...
