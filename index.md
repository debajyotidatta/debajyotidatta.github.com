## Well what exactly will I write about in this blog?

It is mainly my portfolio site but I will also occasionally write about stuff I feel strongly about! Like the story of "buttons"....

Well on a serious note it talks about a very important concept: The importance of designing products for "humans". It is essential and of crucial importance to design products
and devices that not only is easy to use but also gives joy to people.

The abundance of bad and/or terrible design of day to day products show how little thought was given to designing products of everyday use.
I will also occasionally write about good designs... products which bring people joy and make them happy!

Well, welcome to this fascinating world of Human Computer Interaction!


## About me...

I was a Google Summer of Code Intern in 2012 for Connexions, Rice University on the "Donate Now Campaign" Here is a blog post after the [final evaluations](http://blog.cnx.org/2012/08/google-summer-of-code-2012-comes-to.html).
I was also the part of Team Plan-B at the CIMA GBC 2012. We were the western zone finalists and also won the best business report at the Western Zone finals.

I am currently a research assistant at CNRS, Telecom ParisTech working on the [ILHAIRE](http://ilhaire.eu) project. Over here I am synthesizing laughter!
And trying to make it as natural (rather as human-like) as possible! I am using a variety of approaches for doing this and hopefully by the end of the project we
will have full body animation of the virtual agent GRETA.

Till now we are done with head, eyebrow, lips, torso and shoulder animation. (Well the torso and shoulder animation bits are still going on.
    

I reply to everyone... so feel free to drop me a line if you want to know more about any of the stuff I am doing. Or if you have an idea that we can work on together!
