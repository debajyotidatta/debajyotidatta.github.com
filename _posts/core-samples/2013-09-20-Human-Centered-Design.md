For about 6 weeks I took part in a course "Human Centered Design" that was jointly organized by IDEO and Acumen.
Since you probably know about IDEO let me introduce you to [ACUMEN](http://plusacumen.org/).

Even though I did not really think about Human Centered Design before this, this HCD Course was a brilliant experience. 
I got to meet amazing individuals like Azalea, Alizee, Matthew and Lauren through this course. It is always interesting to
learn about how different people approach design. More about that later.... This blog post will serve as a short introduction
to [Human Centered Design](http://plusacumen.org/courses/hcd-for-social-innovation/).


# Human Centered Design - Overview 

### What is Human Centered Design?

Well it simply is : Discover, Ideate, Prototype.

A more detailed description would also include the words: Hear, Create, Deliver.

And an even more detailed description would be somewhat like this:

"Human-centered design is about
believing you can make a difference,
and having an intentional process in
order to get to new, relevant solutions
that create positive impact.

It gives
you faith in your creative abilities
and a process for transforming
difficult challenges into opportunities
for design."


### Doesn't every design have the three stages discover ideate and prototype?

Here comes the next most important part: **Human Centered** Design!

"It’s Human-Centered. Humancentered
design begins from deep
empathy and understanding of needs
and motivations of people—the parents,
neighbors, children, colleagues, and
strangers who make up your everyday
community."

Also another very key feature of this I believe is : It is **experimental**.

"Human-centered
design gives you permission to fail and
to learn from your mistakes, because you
come up with new ideas, get feedback on
them, then iterate. Expecting perfection
makes it hard to take risks. It limits
the possibilities to create more radical
change. Human-centered design is all
about experimenting and learning by
doing. It's about having the confidence
that new, better things are possible and
that you can make them happen. This
kind of optimism is crucial when you're
out to design for social good."


Some examples of HCD would thus include:

-How might we design a cookstove that reduces the amount of smoke inhaled by the user?
-How might we design a toilet for families living in areas with no sanitation infrastructure?
-How might we design hospital waiting rooms to mitigate the transmission of airborne diseases?
-How might we design new services engaging low-income parents in after school education for their children?
-How might we design a water delivery service providing clean drinking water along with health and nutrition products?
-How might we redesign the school lunch program for an entire city while providing for differences in individual schools?
-How might we redesign the banking system in a country to capitalize on unofficial savings activities that lowincome Mexicans are already doing?

Fascinating right? Well I have sent a letter to IDEO about its Copyright policies and as soon as I hear from them
I will write a more detailed post about the entire design process!!
