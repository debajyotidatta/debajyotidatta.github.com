I am a graduate student at the University of Virginia, where I work at understanding the geometry of data. High dimensional data often exhibit interesting geometric properties, and understanding the geometry can provide us insights into domain-specific applications (in education and healthcare). I work with the school of Psychology (to understand depression and anxiety), the School of Medicine, and the Curry School of Education. I am currently the co-chair of the [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) Biomedical group and a contributor to the prompt engineering and bias-fairness group.

After my MS, I worked at [x.ai](https://x.ai/) on many language understanding tasks like intent classification and named entity recognition. Then for a year, I was at [Crossing Minds](https://crossingminds.com/) working on recommendation systems (mostly on large scale matrix factorization). Now back at grad school working with the awesome people at the University of Virginia at [Sensing Systems for Health Lab](https://faculty.virginia.edu/S2HeLab/index.php).
