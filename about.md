I am Debo, (My full name is Debajyoti Datta, and you would pronounce my first name as as they-bo-joe-tee). Currently a data-scientist at x.ai, where we are enabling Amy to magically schedule your meetings.

In the past I have worked on various virtual agent projects at University of Virginia as part of my masters and then before that at Carnegie Mellon University
 as a research assistant. If you want to get in touch with me feel free to reach out to me via linkedin or my email address. (datta <just ignore these> 24421112 @ gmail <ignore this part too> .com)

 There should be a series of blog posts of neural network architecture and nlp in deep learning in the following months and weeks. If you spot an error feel free to send a pull request or email me.
